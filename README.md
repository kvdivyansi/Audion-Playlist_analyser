# Audion-Playlist_analyser
The project aims to create a music playlist analyser that provides users with visualizations of their playlist data, enabling them to better understand and enjoy their musical tastes due to the growth of streaming services.

With Audion, users can create personalized playlists by selecting songs based on genre and language from a diverse collection of popular tracks. Once the playlist is created, the application provides detailed insights such as:
- Total number of songs
- Total playlist duration (in minutes)
- Average song duration
- Mood diversity
- Languages used
- Top artist and top genre

To enhance the experience further, Audion includes smart song recommendations, suggesting 8 songs based on the user’s existing playlist, allowing easy expansion of the playlist.
It also features a Wrapped-style dashboard that visually represents genre distribution, top artists, language breakdown, and mood distribution.

Users can export the playlist as a CSV file or download a text-based summary, making the data easy to share or analyze further.

This project helped us strengthen our skills in Python, data handling, GUI development, recommendation logic, and data visualization.
